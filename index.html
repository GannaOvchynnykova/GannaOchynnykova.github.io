            Yoga and surfing are a perfect match, because the essential requirements for surfing are the same as for yoga:
            
            – Balance
            – Coordination
            – Flexibility
            – Control
            – Strength & Endurance
            
            Accompanying the surf lessons you can participate in 2 daily yoga sessions each morning and afternoon. The yoga classes will take place in our beautiful garden, the wooden deck patio or the pool area surrounded palm trees. Always with panoramic views over the wide ocean. If it should be too uncomfortable for yoga outside, you can find enough space in the house.
            As our yoga instructors also surf, they know exactly what is important in the symbiosis between yoga and surfing and have set appropriate priorities in their exercises.</p>

        <h1 class="main-title"> What is Yoga?</h1>
        <img src="img/yoga-2959226_640.jpg" class="box-main" alt="main">
        <p>Yoga is a technology that uses the knowledge on the functions of the mind and body to create harmony, health, and spiritual connection.</p>
        <p> It’s practice combines breath exercises (pranayama), Yoga positions (asanas), Bhandas (body locks), Mudras (hand positions) and meditation</p>
        <p>Yoga has many benefits. At the beginning it starts with an overall sense of wellbeing, followed by an improvement of some physical, and health related issues, if there are any, but when practice regularly one start noticing a clear, and quieter mind.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, only a few can enjoy a balanced and controlled mind. The benefits of a balanced mind can create a tremendous impact in a one’s life, and the ripple’s effects keep unfolding as the person’s practice deepens.</p>
    <p> I started to practice Yoga as a hobby, and from the very first class it make me feel great. As the time passed, my practice started to deepen, and soon I discovered that practicing Yoga was not only bringing me health and flexibility, but it was balancing my mind and preparing it for meditation. </p>
    <p> “Meditation can give you that which nothing else can give you.
        It introduces you to yourself”</p>
        <p>– Swami Rama.</p>

            <h3>Panchakarma</h3> 
            <p>  Panchakarma is Ayurveda’s main treatment for purification, detoxification and cleansing. The literal definition of Panchakarma is “five therapies” which refers to the treatment’s five basic procedures for eliminating toxins from the body. These procedures include Vamana, Virechana, Basti, Nasya and Raktamokshana (also referred to as Rakta Moksha). Purvakarma refers to pretreatment. The practice of Panchakarma can help to balance the three doshas (vata, pitta and kapha), eliminate deep-rooted stress, and remove illness-causing toxins from the body. Panchakarma can also help to heal disease and promote intelligence, alertness, improved digestion, prolonged youth and stability of the body. </p>

                <h3>Ayurveda</h3>
                <p> Ayurveda is a system of healing which evolved on the subcontinent of India approximately 4000 years ago. Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word derived from two roots “ved” which means knowledge and “ayur” which means long life or life cycle. Thus Ayurveda is a medical system which promotes longevity through knowledge of natural rhythms and cycles. It emphasizes that all beings come out of nature and that we are an integral part of a whole universe. Ayurveda seeks to establish harmony between the individual and the environment and in this way harness the fundamental energies of nature to promote a balanced physiology. The unimpeded rhythmic flow of these fundamental life energies allows the individual to prevent, and when necessary, treat disease.</p>
